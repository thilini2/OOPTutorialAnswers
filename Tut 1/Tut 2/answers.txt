(2) 1) create a new string by appending the sequence of characters of a string to the end of another string.
Strings are immutable and they cannot be changed therefore a new string object is created from the
concatenation.

(3) 1) java.awt.Rectangle[x=0,y=0,width=100,height=50]
       java.awt.Rectangle[x=-10,y=-20,width=120,height=90]

(3) 2) java.awt.Rectangle[x=-10,y=-20,width=120,height=90]
       java.awt.Rectangle[x=-10,y=-20,width=120,height=90]

       This is because reference r2 is made to point to the same memory location that r1 points to 

(3) 3) 150.0 and 3000.0

       The difference between this program and the previous one is that objects are copied by
       reference while primitives by value. Thus, the assignment n2 = n1 will copy the value of
       n1 to n2 but n1 and n2 remain allocated in different memory addresses. Changes to the
       value of one of them will not affect the other one.
